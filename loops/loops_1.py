# Another word for looping is iteration
# or as I would call it iteration bound to intervals

# e.g - if I have 5 els in array then our loop will iterate atleast
#       4/5 times
# e.g   -
#      arr = [0,1,3]
#     for x in arr.length
#       x += 1

# roughly speaking the above will add 1 to x 3 times
#
# so in the end x will equal 3
